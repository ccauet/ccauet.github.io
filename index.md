I am a physicist and data scientist from [Dortmund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund), Germany. I recently moved to [Landau in der Pfalz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau).

I love food, wine, and particularly my charming [wife](http://eva.cauet.de). I read [a lot of stuff](http://ivereadthis.tumblr.com) and have a general interest in science, next-gen technologies, finance, and software development.

I hold a Ph.D. in experimental particle physics from  TU Dortmund University where I studied decay-time dependent CP violation with the [LHCb experiment](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/) located at CERN. Find out more on my [research résumé](/research/).

I'm a member of the alumni association of the TU Dortmund Physics department [PeP et al. e.V.](http://pep-dortmund.org). We are organizing the annual graduation ceremony and a popular summer school, providing student scholarships and support the professional network of current and former faculty members.
