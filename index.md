I am a physicist living and working in Dortmund, Germany. Currently I pursue a Ph.D. in experimental particle physics in the [HEP working group](http://www.physik.uni-dortmund.de/E5/) in Dortmund and at the [LHCb experiment](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/) located at CERN. Find out more on my [research résumé](/research/).

I love food, wine, and particularly my charming [wife](http://eva.cauet.de). I'm a curious person with various interests in science, nature & climate change, next-generation technology, finance, politics, space exploration, and the open source community.
