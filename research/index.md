> ### Focus

My research work was focused on the study of CP violation in systems of beauty mesons, in particular [the measurement of the CKM matrix parameter sin(2β)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07089) in the decay of the B<sup>0</sup> meson and it's anti-particle into the common J/ψ K<sub>S</sub> final state. Previously, I was involved in [the measurement of the B<sup>0</sup> oscillation frequency ∆m<sub>d</sub>](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6750).

As the LHCb detector does not operates on its own, a lot of people are constantly involved in keeping it running. I took part in this task as an LHCb data manager. As a visitor guide I showed interested people around the experiment and tried to provide insights into my work and the value of fundamental science to society.

The day to day tasks consisted in programming (mainly C++ and Python), data analysis and quantitative methods, i.e. statistics, model building, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning, and---of course---meeting with other members of the international LHCb collaboration. I earned profound experience in teaching and in the supervision of B.Sc. and M.Sc. students.
